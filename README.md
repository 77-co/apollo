# Apollo
Apollo is an advanced AI voice assistant with a beautiful UI and various integrations.

## Dependencies
To use Apollo's wake word functionality ("Apollo"), you need to install SoX using one of the following:
- [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/sox/)
- [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/sox) - ``brew install sox``

**Remember to add SoX to path after installing**, if your package manager doesn't do that already.
